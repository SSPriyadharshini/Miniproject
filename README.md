## Title of the Project
Fake News Detection Using Hybrid Deep Learning Model

Small Description

The Fake News Detection system aims to automatically identify whether a news article is real or fake by using a hybrid deep learning approach. The system analyzes textual content and classifies news based on learned linguistic patterns, helping reduce the spread of misinformation on digital platforms.
## About
Fake News Detection Using Hybrid Deep Learning Model is a project designed to identify and classify news articles as real or fake using advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques. With the rapid growth of social media and online news platforms, misinformation spreads quickly and can mislead users.

Traditional methods of manual verification are time-consuming and inefficient. This project addresses the problem by combining multiple deep learning models (such as CNN, LSTM, or BERT) to extract both semantic and contextual features from news text. The hybrid approach improves accuracy and robustness compared to single-model systems.

The system accepts news content as input, preprocesses the text, extracts features, and predicts the authenticity of the news in real time.

## Results and Impact
The Fake News Detection system successfully identifies and classifies news articles as real or fake using a hybrid deep learning approach. By combining multiple models such as CNN, LSTM, and BERT, the system effectively captures both local textual patterns and long-term contextual information from news content.

The experimental results show that the proposed model achieves high accuracy (up to 95.8%), demonstrating better performance compared to traditional machine learning methods. The preprocessing and feature extraction stages significantly reduce noise in the data, improving prediction reliability.

Impact of the Project

Helps in reducing the spread of misinformation on digital platforms

Assists users in verifying news authenticity quickly

Supports media organizations and fact-checking agencies

Improves public awareness and trust in online information

Can be extended for real-time social media monitoring

This project provides a strong foundation for future research in misinformation detection and can be enhanced further by integrating multilingual support, real-time data streaming, and sentiment analysis to build a more robust fake news detection system.
